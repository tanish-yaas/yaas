 * Always-on observations for the dashboard, derived live from the current task
 * rows rather than stored.
 *
 * The AISuggestion table only fills from runIntelligence, which runs once a
 * night, and a row leaves the feed the moment it is accepted or dismissed. So
 * the panel empties out within a day of being read and stays empty until the
 * next 02:00 — which is what it does today. These fill that gap.
 *
 * They are observations, not proposals: nothing here writes, so there is no
 * accept or dismiss and no conflict with "AI proposes, users confirm". Real
 * suggestions still take precedence when any are pending.
